# 🏬 Warehouse Location Optimization for The Good Acre (TGA)

This project was conducted as part of a live case engagement through the **Carlson Analytics Lab** in collaboration with **The Good Acre (TGA)**, a Minnesota-based nonprofit food hub. The objective was to use data-driven decision-making to identify the optimal location for a new warehouse that would expand TGA’s farmer support network and unlock up to **$18 million in untapped revenue**.

## 🧭 Project Background

TGA connects over 150 local farmers with large-scale buyers such as schools, hospitals, and food shelves. As demand for sustainable, locally grown produce increases, TGA sought to scale its operations by opening a second warehouse. The challenge: determine the most strategic location among five candidate counties in Minnesota:
- **Duluth (St. Louis County)**
- **Rochester (Olmsted County)**
- **Willmar (Kandiyohi County)**
- **Owatonna (Steele County)**
- **Fergus Falls (Otter Tail County)**

---

## 🎯 Objective

To evaluate each candidate location based on three key mission-aligned criteria:
1. **Farmer Reach** – Number of small and medium farms (under 180 acres) within 75-mile radius
2. **Revenue Potential** – Number of farms producing top 10 high-revenue commodities
3. **Inclusivity** – Percentage of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) community farmers in the region

## 📊 Methodology

### ✅ Key Steps:
- Aggregated data from USDA Census and public agricultural databases
- Filtered for small/medium farms and top 10 revenue-generating commodities
- Calculated BIPOC representation based on ethnicity indicators from census datasets
- Applied a **75-mile radius** as a practical travel and perishability threshold
- Ranked each county based on all three metrics and computed an **aggregate score**

### 📍 Tools Used:
- **Python** (data cleaning and spatial analysis)
- **Tableau** (interactive dashboard for stakeholder use)
- **Excel/PowerPoint** (summary analysis and presentation)

---

## 🏆 Recommendation

**📍 Owatonna (Steele County)** emerged as the optimal location for TGA’s new warehouse, based on:
- **7,896** small/medium farm operations
- **1,600** farms growing top-10 high revenue crops
- **2.16%** BIPOC farmer representation

This location offered the **best balance of operational feasibility, farmer impact, and inclusivity**.

## 🌱 Impact

This project provided TGA with:
- A replicable, data-driven scoring framework for location planning
- Visual tools to assess trade-offs across mission-driven criteria
- Strategic insights to expand its footprint while reinforcing equity and farmer profitability
